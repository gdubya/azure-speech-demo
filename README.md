# Azure Cognitive Services Speech Demo

This is a small demo project to try out the Azure Cognitive Services Speech API.
In addition to general testing of how it performs with English input, I'm also interested to see how it handles Norwegian, especially my gebrokkent Norsk (Bokm√•l - no support for Nynorsk yet).

## Microphone Demo

Source: [MicDemo.java](src/main/java/com/garethwestern/azure/speech/MicDemo.java)

### Instructions

* Set an environment variable named "SUBSCRIPTION_KEY" with the value of your Speech API key.
* Run the MicDemo main method.
  * You may have to update the deviceId for your microphone. See the Azure documentation for tips on how to do this.
* Start speaking in Norwegian
* Text will be translated continuously. The audio will be sent to Azure for translation when a pause is detected in the input.
* Say "stopp" to terminate the process.

## TODO

* Add demo to get input from a recorded file
* Add demo to get input from a recorded file in a data lake
* Enable automatic language detection
* Try out other API features (e.g. profanity filter)
* Try out techniques for improving WER
* Send the transcribed output somewhere down a pipeline for further processing and/or storage.
